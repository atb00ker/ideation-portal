## Features

The applcation contains contains a lot of basic useful features:

1. Authentication: auth is written in a plug-and-play (dependency injection) manner and you can simply switch to the authentication system you desire. For reference, please checkout [auth0 authentication implementation](src/views/components/Auth/Auth0.tsx) and implement all these functions in your prefered auth provider and [plug your custom file in AuthProvider file](src/views/components/Auth/AuthProvider.tsx).

2. Search / Filter: You of the box, you get the search and filter functionality on the home page, besides that, you can see the `Add` Idea button and the list of ideas below the filters which contain some meta data of the ideas and `Read More` button to checkout the details of the idea.

## Deployment

- Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and update configurations as per requirement.
  - You can get the value for `HASURA_GRAPHQL_JWT_SECRET` [hasura.io/jwt-config tool](https://hasura.io/jwt-config/).
  - `AUTH0_DOMAIN` and `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` can be found in your auth0 account.
  - Ensure you are keeping a secure `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET`.
- Start application using `docker-compose up -d`.

**Note:** If you are deploying to Hasura Cloud, remember to change the value of `from_env` in [`databases.yaml`](src/models/metadata/databases/databases.yaml) from `HASURA_GRAPHQL_METADATA_DATABASE_URL` to `HEROKU_DATABASE_URL` (or whatever your environment variable name is on the cloud) because `HASURA_GRAPHQL_METADATA_DATABASE_URL` wouldn't work.
